@purpose of the project:
	This project is the final project of KTH course ID1212: Network Programming
	In this project I implemented a p2p network using message queue communication paradigm, upon which I built a multiple player rock-paper-scissors game.
	
@Code source & license: 
	 In view part I borrowed some code from previous homework examples, majorly intended to maintain console in/output
	 Here's the license of original code provided by the course lecturer Leif:

	I used message queue for communication, the behavior of which is defined by Java Message Service APIs. In my project I used a open source implementation called OpenJMS, here's the website where I downloaded the resource :http://openjms.sourceforge.net/ 

@How to run:
	(see in folder User guide)

@Code structure:
	In general the project is managed in a traditional MVC structure:
	
	View: View package
	
	Controller: game.adaptor   game.controller   net.controller   net.adaptor
	
	model: game.model  net.model
	
@Control flow:
	(see class diagram in UML folder for better understanding)
	
	The control flow is in general like:
	
	->Read user command from view
	-> interpret the command
	-> action by network controller (create new node/ send message)
	-> wait for message
	-> receive message
	-> pass the message to view level for handling( specifically by GameMsgHandlerImpl instance)
	-> view level reads the new message
	-> action by game controller
	-> pass game result to view layer for console display
